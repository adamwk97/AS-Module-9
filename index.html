<p>The data below is from a study whose research hypothesis was: “There will be a difference between boys and girls in the number of times they raise their hand in class.” For the purposes of this study, boys were coded as 2 on gender; girls were coded as 1 and boys were marked 0.</p>

<p>#1. Find your two sample means.</p>
<p>The sample mean of data (x) is 7.6, while the sample mean of data (y) is 3.57</p>
<p>#2. Find the degrees of freedom(s).</p>
<p>The degree of freedom for data (x) is 4 and the degree of freedom for y is 6.</p>
<p>#3. Find t-test statistic score (s).</p>
<p>The t-statistic score for data (x) is 6.2898048 and the t-statistic for data (y) is 4.9669963.</p>
<p>#4. Find the P value (s).</p>
<p>The p-value for data (x) is 0.003264 and the p-value for data (y) is 0.0025344.</p>
<p>#5. Assume an alpha of .05 was chosen, Would this result have been statistically significant?</p>
<p>Yes, with an alpha of .05, the results are significant because the p-value for data (x) is 0.0032, while the p-value for data (y) is 0.0025. Since both of these values are below 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that gender does in fact play a role in the number of times a student raises their hand.</p>
<p>#6. What critical value would your obtained t-test value have to exceed to be significant at the .01 level (assume a two-tailed test)?</p>
<p>For data set (x), the critical value would be 2(1-pvalue), which would be 1.9934721, and data set (y) would be 1.9949311.</p>
